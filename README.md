# Python-E7-Auto-Refresher

epic seven shop refresher for Stove Client

Concept:

1. Find the Active window and get informations like resolution, size and postion on screen (maybe i can make it only focus the game)
2. open ui and where the user can choose how many sky stones and what loot he wants to buy
   2.1 remember to implement safty rule (no more Skystones, no Gold, disconect etc)
3. Pressing the start button it checks window size and postion again and makes screenshots and moves the mouse acordingly adjusting to the postion of the window
   IDEA: maybe it is posible to not use mouse inputs but clicks on certrains parts on the screen so the user is free to use their mouse
